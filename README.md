# -Design-and-implementation-of-the-motion-controller-for-the-holonomic-mobile-robot-on-the-FPGA-board
 Final thesis of Bachelorâ€™s degree.  Advanced knowledge in the area of robotics, FPGA-based control and mechatronic systems.

The aim of this paper is to create a control system for holonomic robot called Holbos. We
will learn about new technology, FPGA, Real-Time simulation and software package
LabVIEW. Moreover, we will analyse the working principles of stepper motors, the
advantages, their drawbacks, different types, their uses and ways in which we can control
them. The final goal is controling the driving mechanisam of the robot, that is, controling all
of its wheels simultaneously.
